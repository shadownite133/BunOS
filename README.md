## This is the official BunOS Linux Distro Repo, hosting the ISO and Installation guides and resources
BunOS is a Ubuntu 22.04-derived OS for amd64 Computers, done as a side project literally in 2 weeks total, I did this to expand my knowledge of linux.
# My Inspiration
BunOS is named for my catto, Loki, whom I nicknamed Bun because he looks like a hamburger bun when curled up.
[Here is Loki](./images/Loki.jpg)
# Installation
## I apologize but it is unable to be built, you have to download the binary.
[How to Install](./INSTALLATION.md)
