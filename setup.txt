Then go to firefox and go to github.com/KirbyJeff/BunOS/ and download "bun-stat"
Then open a terminal and type the following: "sudo cp /home/$USER/Downloads/bun-stat /usr/bin" and press enter.

      /     .-+sssooossssooosss+-.    \ "
     /   :+sssssssssssssssssssssso:    \ "
    / -+sssssssssssssssssssssssssssss+- \ "
   /.osssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss\ "
